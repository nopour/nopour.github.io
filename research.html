                <p>
		This projeect aims for the elastostatic, and constraint-wrench analyses of McGill SMG, a robotic mechanical systems.
		first the constraint wrenches of a mechanical system, imposed by the kinematic pairs, is proposed.
		In the next step, considering link elasticity, a novel method for the elastostatic
		analysis of parallel robots is proposed. This method is based on the concept of generalized spring.

                <h3>Data Mining </h3>
                <p>
		There are various techniques for producing and collecting data, and these techniques are expanding and improving every day, but the vital issue in data science is how to use this type of data.
		The rapid growth of data retrieval methods and the expansion of databases require the development of new technologies for processing this data into valuable information by using new and automated methods.
		Matrices are seldom considered when thinking about data science in general or specific areas, such as machine learning or computer vision. This project shows how a low-rank class can be extracted in 2D in a 3D image with significant deviation.
		This method takes into account local features, including edges and corners and symmetrical patterns. The method of extracting these cases is the use of low-rank matrices with high dimensions.
		In this study, symmetrical patterns, building facades, printed texts, and human faces are considered examples. This study aims to accurately retrieve the low-rank texture of an image that contains a deformed and damaged version.
	        Finally, by changing the solution method in calculating SVD, an attempt has been made to improve the results, i.e., increasing the speed and reducing the error.

                <p>Although a wide range of attempts are already made

			structures, there exists no article addressing the
			coupled influences of waviness of CNTs and time-dependent
			nature of the polymer on the dynamic responses of MSH
