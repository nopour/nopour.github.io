		Because of lack of an analytical study concerning the smart active control of the free fluctuations of laminated panels consisted of an auxetic layer in the literature,
		we were motivated and arranged a paper to analyze the actively controlled vibrational characteristics of smart laminates possessing an auxetic behavior </p>

                <p>Although a wide range of attempts are already made
			toward analyzing the mechanical behaviors of MSH nanocomposite
			structures, there exists no article addressing the
			coupled influences of waviness of CNTs and time-dependent
			nature of the polymer on the dynamic responses of MSH
			nanocomposite structures. Therefore, we were motivated
			to compensate this lack of data herein with the aid of
			advanced micromechanical schemes.</p>
